# rs/CLAUDE.md

Reference for the `/rs` Cargo workspace. Universal rules (writing style, no em dashes, Root Cause First, Cross-Package Sync, Public API Scrutiny, Refactor As You Go) live in the root `/CLAUDE.md`; PR/commit/release mechanics live in `/CONTRIBUTING.md`. Neither is repeated here.

Workspace members live in the root `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace]`). `rust-version = "1.91"` (the library floor; `moq-relay` overrides to 1.95 for `sysinfo`), edition 2024. Shared versions/paths are pinned under `[workspace.dependencies]`; new crates should add their dep there and reference it via `{ workspace = true }`.

## Crate Map

Layered roughly transport -> container/format -> media -> apps/bindings.

**Transport / protocol**

- `moq-net` (lib): the core wire layer. Negotiates `moq-lite` or IETF `moq-transport`. Owns the Broadcast/Track/Group/Frame model and the Producer/Consumer split (see below). Generic over `web_transport_trait::Session` (no concrete QUIC dep). Each level of the hierarchy is a public role module that owns short names (`broadcast::Consumer`, `track::Producer`, `group::Info`, `frame::Producer`, `origin::Consumer`, `announce::Consumer`); origin + announce share one private implementation surfaced as two curated modules. Traffic counters for those levels live in the `stats` module (`stats::Registry` collects, `stats::Handle` is what a session bumps through); publishing them as broadcasts lives in `moq-stats`.
- `moq-native` (lib): native connection helpers. `ClientConfig`/`ServerConfig` wrap QUIC backends (Quinn/Quiche/Noq/Iroh), WebTransport, WebSocket, TCP (qmux), Unix sockets, TLS, cert hot-reload, logging, jemalloc. Re-exports `moq_net`. Example: `examples/clock.rs`.
- `kio` (lib): "easy async". `Producer<T>`/`Consumer<T>` shared-state channels with `Waiter`-based notification, built on `std::task::Waker`, no runtime dependency. Underpins all the `poll_*` plumbing in moq-net and moq-mux. `src/producer.rs`, `src/consumer.rs`, `src/waiter.rs`. Implement `Pollable` (a `poll(&Waiter)` computation) and wrap it in `Pending` to get a `std::future::Future` (`src/pollable.rs`). Guard discipline: the synchronous methods (`write`, `poll*`) report closure as `Err(Ref)`, a live lock guard; the `async` ones report it as `kio::Closed` instead, since an `Err` held across a later `.await` would stall every other handle.

**Container / catalog formats** (standalone specs, mostly no moq-\* deps, reused by moq-mux)

- `hang` (lib): media layer on `moq-net`. `catalog/` is the JSON manifest (`Catalog`, root.rs); `container/` is the frame format (timestamp + codec payload, `container::Frame`).
- `moq-loc` (lib): LOC (Low Overhead Container) wire frame codec. Top-level `encode`/`decode` + `Frame`. QUIC varints, property KVPs.
- `moq-msf` (lib): IETF MSF/CMSF catalog types (`Catalog`, `Track`, `Packaging`, `Role`). serde JSON. Alternative to hang's catalog.
- `moq-json` (lib): generic JSON publishing over a track, in two modules. `snapshot` is lossy latest-value (RFC 7396 merge-patch deltas; consumers only get the most recent value; `Producer<T>`/`Consumer<T>`, `Guard<T>` RAII edit); `stream` is a lossless append-log (every record preserved in order). DEFLATE via `moq-flate`.
- `moq-flate` (lib): group-scoped DEFLATE primitive (no moq deps). `Encoder`/`Decoder` turn a stream of payloads into self-delimited sync-flushed frames sharing one window (RFC 7692 marker trick), so similar frames compress against the earlier ones. Used by `moq-json`; reusable by any framed stream.
- `moq-stats` (lib): stats publishing and consumption over `moq-net` + `moq-json`. `Producer` drains a `moq_net::stats::Registry` on an interval into per-node JSON tracks (plain `.json` plus compressed `.json.z` siblings); `Consumer` yields typed `TrafficFrame`/`SessionsFrame` off one stats broadcast; `parse_node_path` + track-name helpers cover the announce/track naming scheme. The relay's stats surface is this crate.

**Media bridge / codecs**

- `moq-mux` (lib): the conversion layer. File/stream formats (`container/`: fmp4, flv, mkv, ts, loc) and codec parsers (`codec/`: h264, h265, av1, vp8/9, opus, aac, ...) <-> hang broadcasts. `Container` trait + generic `Producer<C>`/`Consumer<C>`. Dual catalog (`catalog::hang`, `catalog::msf`).
- `moq-audio` (lib): native PCM <-> Opus/PCM (`unsafe-libopus`). Shaped like `moq-video`: `capture::Config`, `encode::{Encoder, Producer, publish_capture}`, `decode::{Consumer, Decoder}`, plus root `Error`/`Format`/`Frame`. Playback is the extra role module `moq-video` has no counterpart for: `playback::{Engine, Config, Sink, Control, Input, Device, devices}`, where one `Engine` owns the output device and mixes up to 64 `Sink`s into it on a driver thread. `aec::{Canceller, Config}` closes the loop between the two: `Engine::canceller` taps the post-mix signal and `capture::Config::aec` subtracts it from the microphone (`sonora`, a pure-Rust WebRTC APM port), which is what a call on a laptop needs to not send itself back. Optional `capture` feature (cpal microphone, macOS system audio), `playback` feature (cpal output, `fixed-resample` ring buffers), and `aec` feature (implies both).
- `moq-video` (lib): native video capture, H.264/H.265 encode, and decode; no ffmpeg. Hardware backends (VideoToolbox / Media Foundation / NVENC / VAAPI / NVDEC) with openh264 as the software H.264 fallback; NVDEC frames stay in CUDA memory and feed NVENC zero-copy. `capture::Config`, `encode::{Encoder, Producer, publish_capture}`, `decode::{Consumer, Decoder}`, root `Error`/`Size`.
- `moq-transcode` (lib): just-in-time live transcoding of hang broadcasts. `run(source, output, config)` publishes a derivative catalog (ladder rungs + relative refs to the source) and encodes each rung only while subscribed/fetched, via `moq-video`. Live rungs share one decode per source (the `feed` module); output groups mirror source group sequences 1:1. Also a moq-cli verb (`moq ... transcode`, feature-gated).

**Apps / binaries**

- `moq-relay` (lib+bin): clusterable, media-agnostic relay. axum HTTP API, JWT auth, WebSocket fallback, clustering. Config/TOML merge pattern lives here (see below).
- `moq-cli` (bin, `moq`): the unified media router (`moq <MoQ side> <import|export> <endpoint>`, plus the feature-gated `transcode` verb); stdin/stdout media piping. The CLI surface for the gateway library crates below lives here. `token` and `devices` are the local verbs: they run before any transport is bound and reject a MoQ side rather than ignoring it.
- `moq-rtc` (lib): WebRTC (WHIP/WHEP) gateway. Bridges browser WebRTC ingest/playback to MoQ broadcasts (str0m ICE/DTLS, A/V sync, NACK). Embeddable axum routers / `Client`; the CLI surface lives in `moq-cli`.
- `moq-rtmp` (lib): RTMP / enhanced-RTMP gateway (ingest + egress, `rml_rtmp`, FLV via `moq-mux`). RTMPS (rustls + tokio-rustls) is the optional `tls` feature.
- `moq-srt` (lib): bidirectional SRT gateway (MPEG-TS via `srt-tokio` + `moq-mux`).
- `moq-hls` (lib): HLS / LL-HLS gateway (import + export, playlists + fMP4 via `moq-mux`).
- `moq-bench` (bin): relay load generator. `JoinSet`-spawned staggered connections, rand sampling.
- `moq-boy` (bin): crowd-controlled Game Boy emulator publisher (blocking emulator thread + async monitor tasks).
- `moq-token` (lib): JWT auth. `Claims`, `Algorithm`, `KeyMaterial` (EC/RSA/OCT/OKP), JWKS. No clap, no anyhow: the command surface lives a layer up.
- `moq-token-cli` (lib+bin, `moq-token`): the generate/sign/verify commands, as `moq_token_cli::Args`. The `moq-token` binary flattens it and `moq token` (moq-cli) nests it, so there's one implementation and two entry points. It's a lib so moq-cli can reuse it without pulling clap and anyhow into the `moq-token` library's API.

**Bindings**

- `moq-ffi` (cdylib+staticlib): UniFFI bindings (Python/Swift/Kotlin/Go). Proc-macro based (`uniffi::setup_scaffolding!("moq")`, `#[uniffi::Object]`/`#[uniffi::export]`), no `.udl`. Exposes `Moq*Producer`/`Moq*Consumer`, `MoqError` (`#[uniffi(flat_error)]`).
- `libmoq` (staticlib): C bindings. `cbindgen` `build.rs` emits `moq.h` + pkg-config. `extern "C"` over opaque handles; dedicated tokio runtime thread (`LazyLock`).
- `moq-gst` (cdylib): GStreamer plugin. `gst::plugin_define!`, `moqsrc`/`moqsink` elements bridging to a background tokio task.
- `moq-wasm` (cdylib+rlib): browser/WASM bindings, `wasm-bindgen` over `moq-net`. Consumed by `js/wasm` (`@moq/wasm`); build via `just wasm`.

When you change `moq-ffi`'s surface, mirror it in `libmoq` and the language wrappers (see the Cross-Package Sync table in root).

## Producer / Consumer Model (moq-net)

The whole stack is built on a split-handle pattern: a `Producer` writes, one or more `Consumer`s read, state is shared via `kio`. This recurs in moq-net, moq-mux, moq-json.

Each level is a role module (`broadcast`, `track`, `group`, `frame`, `origin`, `announce`) owning short `Producer`/`Consumer` names:

- Broadcast: `broadcast::{Producer, Consumer, Dynamic}` (`model/broadcast.rs`).
- Track: `track::{Producer, Consumer, Subscriber, ...}` plus the `pub(crate)` `track::TrackWeak` (`model/track.rs`).
- Group: `group::{Producer, Consumer, Info}` (`model/group.rs`). Consumers `clone()` for fanout.
- Frame: `frame::Producer` / `frame::Consumer` (`model/frame.rs`).
- Origin: `origin::{Producer, Consumer}` for the broadcast set; `announce::{Producer, Consumer}` for (un)announce events. Both share the private `origin.rs` implementation (`mod origin_impl`), surfaced via `model/mod.rs`.

## Async / poll plumbing

Two ways to drive things, both backed by `kio`:

- `async fn` (runs on any executor; the exception is timer-backed paths like driving a session, which need a tokio runtime on native because `web_async::time` wraps tokio's time driver, see the Async section of `moq-net/src/lib.rs`).
- `poll_*` counterparts that take a `&kio::Waiter` and return `Poll<...>`, drivable from any executor or synchronously (`kio` is built on `std::task::Waker`). The `async` method usually just wraps the `poll_*` one via `kio::wait`. Example pair: `track::Consumer::poll_recv_group` / `recv_group` (`moq-net/src/model/track.rs`).

Sessions are caller-driven: `Client::connect` / `Server::accept` return a `(Session, Driver)` pair; nothing is spawned behind the caller's back. The `Session` is the handle, with the library's usual refcount lifecycle (clones share the connection, transport closes when the last clone drops, `abort(err)` closes explicitly). The `Driver` is the future running the protocol work: spawn it, await it in place, or step `Driver::poll(&kio::Waiter)` from another poll function. The invariant that keeps close-on-last-drop honest: **the `Driver` holds no `Session` clone**, so handing it to an executor never keeps the session alive (`moq-net/src/session.rs`). moq-native's `connect`/`ok` spawn the driver on tokio and return the plain `moq_net::Session`.

Follow the root `poll_*` conventions: collapse `Poll::Pending => Poll::Pending` with `ready!(...)`, and prefer `Ok(x?)` over `.map_err(Into::into)` so a fallible poll reads `let v = ready!(inner.poll_next(cx))?;`. Representative `ready!` sites: `moq-mux/src/container/consumer.rs`, `moq-net/src/model/group.rs`.

## Version matching

`moq_net::Version` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, splitting `Lite(lite::Version)` and `Ietf(ietf::Version)` (`version.rs`). The inner `lite::Version` / `ietf::Version` payloads are crate-private, so outside `moq-net` you branch on the accessors rather than on variants: `is_lite()` / `is_ietf()` for the protocol family, and `alpn()` / `code()` for the specific draft.

```rust
// Outside the crate: family first, then the ALPN string for a specific draft.
if version.is_lite() {
    // moq-lite behavior
} else {
    match version.alpn() {
        "moqt-15" | "moqt-16" => { /* old behavior */ }
        _ => { /* newest / draft-17+ behavior */ }
    }
}
```

Inside `moq-net`, match the inner draft enums directly. Either way, default to the **newest** draft so future versions fall forward, and list older versions explicitly:

```rust
match version {
    ietf::Version::Draft14 | ietf::Version::Draft15 | ietf::Version::Draft16 => { /* old behavior */ }
    _ => { /* newest / draft-17+ behavior */ }
}
```

Negotiation: `version::NEGOTIATED` lists SETUP-negotiated versions in preference order; newer drafts negotiate via dedicated ALPNs (`version::ALPNS`). The version-to-behavior dispatch lives in `SetupVersion::from_version` (`setup.rs`).

## Invariants and footguns

- **No cascading abort**: Broadcast/Track/Group/Frame closes stay independent so handles can be shared. Closing or aborting one layer must not tear down its parent or siblings.
- **`moq_net::Timestamp` scales**: it's an instant, not a scalar, so it has no `+`/`-` operators. `checked_add`/`checked_sub` require matching scales and return `Err` (never panic) otherwise; `.convert()` to align scales first. `Ord::cmp` is scale-aware and safe, but `Eq`/`Hash` are structural (`from_secs(1) != from_millis(1000)`). `ZERO` is second-scale, so don't seed a `.max()` accumulator with it (a finer-scale value loses the tie-break); use an `Option` instead.

## Rust conventions

- **Prefer `kio` over tokio sync primitives**: reach for `kio::Producer`/`Consumer` (and the `poll_*` plumbing) instead of `tokio::sync` channels or `watch`. A `tokio::sync::watch` (or a channel) carrying a single value is a code smell. `kio` ties into the runtime-free `poll_*` model and avoids a hard runtime dependency.
- **Errors**: `thiserror` with `#[from]` for libraries, `anyhow` (with `.context("...")`, not `.map_err(|_| anyhow!())`) for binaries. Always `#[non_exhaustive]` on public error enums (e.g. `moq-net/src/error.rs`, `moq-ffi/src/error.rs`, `moq-loc/src/lib.rs`). Use `#[error(transparent)]` + `#[from]` for wrapped foreign errors (see `moq-token/src/error.rs`).
- **Config + TOML merge**: any `#[arg]` field on a TOML-loadable config must be `Option<T>`, never a bare `bool`/`String`/etc. The TOML->CLI merge re-applies clap defaults and silently clobbers TOML values for bare fields. See `moq-relay/src/config.rs` and its regression tests (`cli_does_not_clobber_toml_*`); add such a test for any new flag.
- **Config structs**: `#[derive(Parser, Serialize, Deserialize)]` with `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields, default)]`, clap `#[arg(long, env = "MOQ_...")]`, nested configs via `#[command(flatten)]`, and an `.init()`/`.load()` method that produces the live object. See the `#[non_exhaustive]` conventions below for whether the struct gets the attribute and/or a builder.
- **`#[non_exhaustive]`: do NOT add this by default.** Most public structs and enums should not have it; a diff that sprinkles it on new types is wrong. Its only job is to keep *adding* a field/variant from being a semver-breaking change, and it earns its keep in exactly three cases:

  1. Public error enums: always (see Errors above).
  2. A public enum that will realistically gain variants, so external `match`es keep compiling.
  3. A struct that will probably grow with additive, *defaultable* fields (the classic `Config`), paired with `Default`/a constructor so callers build via `default()`/`new()` + field set, not a struct literal. Prefer adding a field to such a struct over adding a positional parameter.

  Skip it everywhere else: on a struct that won't grow, or where a new field would *change behavior* rather than default to a no-op. There the addition should be a deliberate breaking change, not one the attribute waves through.
- **Enum variant order**: append new variants to the end of a public fieldless enum that uses implicit discriminants. Inserting one earlier changes the numeric values exposed by `as`, which is a semver break even when the enum is `#[non_exhaustive]`.
- **Builders** (private fields + chained `.with_x()` setters) are the orthogonal construction-ergonomics layer: reach for one when a struct has a lot of optional knobs, or is `#[non_exhaustive]` and you want construction to stay clean as fields get added (e.g. `select::Broadcast`).
- **Make misuse unrepresentable in the type system** (root Public API Scrutiny): make terminal operations consume `self` (e.g. `fn close(self)`) so use-after-close can't even be written, rather than `&mut self` plus a `closed` flag. Return owned handles whose `Drop` runs the cleanup instead of asking callers to remember a teardown call.
- **Borrow in, own out**: a parameter the callee only reads is a slice (`&[T]`, `&str`), and what you hand back is owned (`Vec<T>`, `String`). `fn publish(&mut self, encoded: &[Encoded])` accepts a `Vec`, an array, a boxed slice, or a sub-range without the caller rebuilding anything, and the signature already says the callee won't keep it. Take `Vec<T>` only when it genuinely takes ownership of the elements: it stores them (`I420::new(w, h, data: Vec<u8>)`) or moves fields out of them. When it merely consumes them once, `impl IntoIterator<Item = T>` says that without demanding a `Vec` the caller may not have.
- **Unwrapping**: prefer `if let Some(v) = x { ... }` / `let Some(v) = x else { ... };` over a `match` whose only job is to bind the inner value. Keep `match` when both arms do real work.
- **Naming / namespacing**: name by role, not by today's only implementation (`capture::Config`, `publish_capture`, not `CameraConfig`/`publish_camera`), so a second implementation slots in without a rename; don't bundle generic options under a specific-case name. Split a growing crate into role modules (`capture`, `encode`, `decode`) so each owns short, unprefixed names: the module supplies the prefix, so `encode::Config` beats `EncoderConfig` and `encode::Producer` beats `VideoProducer`. Don't nest a module whose name echoes its main type (`encode::encoder::Encoder` stutters): keep `mod encoder` private and re-export flat (`pub use encoder::{Encoder, Config}`) so it reads `encode::Encoder`.
- **Deprecation mechanics** (root Deprecation explains the why): a deprecated CLI flag stays a hidden alias (clap `alias = "..."`, or a separate `#[arg(..., hide = true)]` when it needs its own runtime deprecation warning); a deprecated public item gets `#[doc(hidden)]` **and** `#[deprecated(note = "...")]`. Reach for the attribute: it fires at the *use* site, which is the whole point, while `#[doc(hidden)]` drops the symbol off docs.rs. What's banned is advertising the dead name on a published surface: no `--help` entry, and no "deprecated, use X" prose in the doc comment itself. Deprecating an item we still call internally also warns on our own call sites (CI runs `-D warnings`), so repoint those at the private helper.

## Binary setup

Binaries are `#[tokio::main] async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()>`. Install the rustls crypto provider before anything TLS:

```rust
rustls::crypto::aws_lc_rs::default_provider().install_default().expect("crypto provider");
```

Then `Config::load()?` (initializes tracing), build clients/servers via `.init()`, and run an event loop with `tokio::select!`. See `moq-relay/src/main.rs`, `moq-bench/src/main.rs`.

## Testing

- `just check` runs all tests + lint; `just fix` auto-fixes formatting/lint. `just rs test -p <crate>` (or `cargo nextest run -p <crate>`) for one crate.

- **Run tests through nextest, not `cargo test`.** `.config/nextest.toml` sets a
  `slow-timeout` with `terminate-after`, so a wedged test is reported as a
  TIMEOUT and killed; under `cargo test`'s harness the same test hangs forever,
  holding the target lock and burning a core. That matters here because a lost
  `kio` wakeup parks a task with nothing to wake it, which is a hang rather than
  a failure. `just rs test` and `just rs ci` both use nextest. Doctests are the
  one thing it skips (`just rs doctest` covers them), and `just rs loom` stays on
  `cargo test` since loom needs its own `--cfg loom` build.

- **A test flagged SLOW is a bug to fix, not a threshold to raise.** The whole
  workspace runs in well under a minute and the slowest single test is a few
  seconds, which is what makes the timeout above a meaningful signal. When a
  dependency is the reason (crypto and bignum code is orders of magnitude slower
  unoptimized), give it an `opt-level` override in the root `Cargo.toml` rather
  than shrinking what the test covers: `[profile.dev.package.<dep>]` applies to
  test builds too, and took the moq-token RSA keygen tests from 16s to 0.8s while
  still generating production-size 2048-bit keys.

- Rust tests are `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` inline in the source file.

- Async tests that depend on time call `tokio::time::pause()` first so timers fire instantly and deterministically (e.g. the tests in `moq-net/src/model/origin.rs`).

- Config-merge regressions belong next to the config (`moq-relay/src/config.rs::tests`); they serialize env mutation with a lock since clap reads env.

- **`just check` only compiles the host's platform.** `#[cfg(target_os = "...")]` code for other platforms is invisible to it, and `cargo fmt` skips those modules too. Each platform has its own gate, and each only runs on that platform's runner:

  - Windows (moq-video's Media Foundation and D3D11 backends): `just rs windows`, via `.github/workflows/windows.yml`. You can't reproduce it off Windows, since cross-compiling dies in openh264-sys2's vendored C++.
  - macOS (moq-video's VideoToolbox and ScreenCaptureKit, moq-audio's system audio): `just rs macos`, via `.github/workflows/macos.yml`. Scoped to moq-video + moq-audio, and needs `--all-features` because moq-audio's capture backend is off by default.
  - Linux: no separate gate needed. `just rs ci` already runs `--all-features` in a dev shell carrying pipewire/libva/alsa, so nvenc/nvdec/vaapi/pipewire all compile.

  Both extra gates are path-filtered, so a change outside their trigger paths that breaks them surfaces on the merge commit rather than the PR.

- **`just rs loom` is a manual gate. Run it by hand whenever you touch kio's refcount/waiter plumbing (`lock.rs`, `producer.rs`, `consumer.rs`, `weak.rs`, `waiter.rs`) or moq-net's model layer (`model/`), and mention the result in the PR.** Nothing else will run it: `--cfg loom` swaps kio's Mutex/atomics for loom's instrumented ones, which rebuilds the whole dependency tree and can't share artifacts with a normal `cargo test`, so it's deliberately outside `check`/`ci`. Budget about a minute of model checking on top of that build. The search is exhaustive on purpose, so don't reach for `preemption_bound` to speed it up; the recipe already buys the speed back with `--release`, which matters here because a model check reruns the body once per interleaving.

  Loom permutes every thread interleaving instead of hoping a stress loop hits the bad one. It caught a `ProducerWeak::produce` race that had been live for months, on iteration 4. Reading the results:

  - A **hang is a finding, not a flake**: a parked `loom::future::block_on` that never wakes leaves every thread blocked, which loom reports as a deadlock. That's how a lost wakeup surfaces.
  - **"Arc leaked"** means a reference cycle, usually a handle stored inside the state it points at. That's what `kio::Weak` (as opposed to `ProducerWeak`, which keeps the allocation) exists to avoid.
  - Before trusting a *passing* model, mutate the code it covers and confirm it fails. A model that never exercises the race is worse than none.

  Two constraints when adding to it: every non-loom `#[cfg(test)]` in kio must be `#[cfg(all(test, not(loom)))]`, or the tokio tests build loom primitives outside `loom::model` and panic; and loom's `Arc` has no `downgrade`, so `lock.rs` and `waiter.rs` keep std's (see `kio/src/sync.rs`).
