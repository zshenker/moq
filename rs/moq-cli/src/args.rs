//! The unified moq-cli argument surface.
//!
//! Grammar: `moq <MoQ side> <import|export> <endpoint> [endpoint opts]`.
//!
//! - The MoQ side (`--client-connect` / `--server-bind`, both optional, at least
//!   one) attaches the shared Origin to the MoQ network, and comes before the
//!   verb. Both may be given: dial a relay *and* accept incoming sessions.
//! - `import` routes media INTO MoQ from one source; `export` routes it OUT to
//!   one sink. The verb fixes the data direction (and thus, for the
//!   bidirectional gateways, whether `--connect`/`--listen` push or pull).
//! - `devices` touches no network at all, so it's the one verb that takes no MoQ
//!   side. That's why the requirement is enforced per-verb ([`MoqSide::validate`])
//!   rather than by clap: an `ArgGroup` can't be conditional on the subcommand.
//! - The endpoint is one subcommand: a container format (`ts`, `fmp4`, ... read
//!   from stdin on import, written to stdout on export) or a gateway (`hls`,
//!   `rtmp`, `srt`, `rtc`). Exactly one per invocation, so "which endpoint" is
//!   unambiguous and there's no silently-ignored flag.
