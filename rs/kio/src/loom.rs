//! Loom model checks for the kio channel primitives.
//!
//! kio is the shared state under every moq-net handle, so a lost wakeup or a
//! resurrected channel here surfaces as a stalled subscription several layers up.
//! These tests permute the thread interleavings exhaustively instead of hoping a
//! stress loop hits the bad one.
//!
//! Two failure modes are in scope:
//!
//! - **Lost wakeup**: a parked [`loom::future::block_on`] that is never woken leaves
//!   every thread blocked, which loom reports as a deadlock. So "the assertion" for
//!   these is simply that the test terminates.
//! - **Bad state**: a handle observing something the API promises it can't, asserted
//!   directly.
//!
//! Run with `just rs loom`; `cfg(loom)` is never set in a normal build.
