//! Producer/consumer shared state with async waker-based notification.
//!
//! This crate provides [`Producer`] and [`Consumer`] types that share state through
//! a mutex-protected value. Producers can modify the state and consumers are
//! automatically notified via async wakers. The channel auto-closes when all
//! producers are dropped.
//!
//! For state that both sides legitimately mutate (e.g. a reverse request queue),
//! [`Shared`] is a role-less sibling: every handle can lock, read, or park on a
//! predicate, with no liveness of its own.
//!
//! [`Queue`] is a poll-native FIFO queue built in the same style: role-less
//! clone-able handles, bounded or unbounded, with separate wake lists for the
//! push and pop sides.
