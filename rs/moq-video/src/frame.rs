//! [`Frame`]: one raw picture, and [`Surface`]: its pixels and where they live.
//!
//! Representations chosen so the common path stays zero-copy:
//! - `Surface::PixelBuffer` is a macOS `CVPixelBuffer` (IOSurface-backed NV12).
//!   Capture and the VideoToolbox decoder both produce it, and the VideoToolbox
//!   encoder consumes it directly, no copy and no color conversion.
//! - `Surface::Texture` is a Windows Direct3D11 NV12 texture, produced by Media
//!   Foundation capture and decode one GPU blit removed from their own pools
//!   (which they recycle, so a frame has to be lifted out of them), and consumed
//!   by the hardware encoder MFT on the same device with no copy at all, so a
//!   camera or a decoder reaches an encoder without touching the CPU. Drawing one
//!   still goes through `into_i420`, since the render module imports a
//!   `PixelBuffer` but has no Direct3D11 path yet.
// `render` is deliberately not a doc link: the module sits behind a non-default
// feature, so linking it fails the `-D warnings` rustdoc build of a plain build.
//! - `Surface::I420` is CPU-resident planar I420, for the CPU encode path and
//!   platforms without a zero-copy capture.
//!
//! A backend that consumes a GPU surface takes the frame as-is; a CPU encoder
//! asks for I420 via [`Surface::into_i420`], which downloads the GPU frame only when
//! needed.
