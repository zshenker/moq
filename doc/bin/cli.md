# FFmpeg / moq-cli

`moq-cli` is a media router: it wires one endpoint onto a shared MoQ Origin. It
moves media into MoQ from a source, or out of MoQ to a sink, bridging stdin/stdout
(via FFmpeg), HLS, RTMP, SRT, and WebRTC.

## Installation

### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install moq-cli
```

### Using winget (Windows)

```powershell
winget install moq-dev.moq-cli
```

### Using Nix

```bash
# Run directly
nix run github:moq-dev/moq#moq-cli

# Or build and find the binary in ./result/bin/
nix build github:moq-dev/moq#moq-cli
```

### Using Docker

```bash
docker pull moqdev/moq-cli

# moq-cli reads media from stdin, so pipe an MPEG-TS stream into the container.
# `-i` forwards stdin to the container process.
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c copy -f mpegts - | \
    docker run -i moqdev/moq-cli --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang import ts
```

Multi-arch images (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`) are published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/moqdev/moq-cli).

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moq-dev/moq
cd moq
cargo build --release --bin moq-cli
```

The binary will be in `target/release/moq-cli`.

### Heap profiling

The Nix package includes jemalloc profiling support. Source builds can opt in
with `--features jemalloc`. Start `moq` with profiling enabled and then send
`SIGUSR1` whenever a heap snapshot is needed:

```bash
MALLOC_CONF=prof:true,prof_active:true,prof_prefix:/tmp/moq.heap moq ...
kill -USR1 <pid>
```

Each signal writes a numbered `/tmp/moq.heap.*.heap` profile for analysis with
`jeprof`.

## The grammar

```
moq <MoQ side>  <import|export>  <endpoint> [endpoint options]
```

- **MoQ side** attaches the Origin to the network, and comes before the verb. At
  least one of:

  - `--client-connect <url>` dials a relay. The URL path is the relay auth path
    (e.g. `/anon`), `?jwt=<token>` supplies a token, and `--broadcast` names the
    broadcast.
  - `--server-bind <addr>` hosts MoQ sessions directly (with `--tls-generate` /
    `--tls-cert` + `--tls-key`).
  - `--cluster-lan` meshes with every other participating process on the LAN
    via mDNS, no relay or internet needed. See [LAN Cluster](#lan-cluster-mdns).

  Any combination may be given at once (e.g. dial a relay *and* accept incoming
  sessions).
  `--origin <id>` pins the process's origin id (default: fresh and random per
  run); see [Redundant Publishers](#redundant-publishers-11).
- **`import`** routes media INTO MoQ (a source fills the Origin); **`export`**
  routes it OUT (a sink drains the Origin). The verb fixes the data direction.
- **endpoint** is one subcommand: a container format (`avc3`, `fmp4`, `ts`, `flv`
  read from stdin on import; `fmp4`, `mkv`, `ts`, `flv` written to stdout on
  export), or a gateway (`hls`, `rtmp`, `srt`, `rtc`). For the bidirectional
  gateways, `--connect` dials out and `--listen` binds a socket; the parent verb
  decides whether that pushes or pulls.

Run `moq import --help` / `moq export --help` to see the endpoints, and
`moq import rtmp --help` for a specific one.

Two verbs sit outside this grammar because they never touch the network:
[`moq token`](#authentication) manages relay JWTs, and `moq devices` lists the
capture devices in a build with the `capture` feature enabled. Both take no MoQ
side and reject one if given.

## Basic Usage

`moq <MoQ side> import <format>` reads a container from stdin;
`moq <MoQ side> export <format>` writes one to stdout.

### Publish a Video File

Remux a file to MPEG-TS and pipe it in (`-c copy` avoids re-encoding):

```bash
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c copy -f mpegts - | \
    moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang import ts
```

### LAN Cluster (mDNS)

`--cluster-lan` advertises the process over mDNS (DNS-SD,
`_moq._udp.local`) and connects to every other participating MoQ process on
the LAN, no relay, internet, or certificate setup needed. Each process runs a
QUIC listener with a generated certificate and advertises its port plus the
certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint. Dialers pin that fingerprint, so sessions
are encrypted without a CA. Each pair opens one bidirectional session and
shares one set of broadcasts, like a miniature relay cluster:

```bash
# On one machine: publish a stream to the LAN.
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c copy -f mpegts - | \
    moq --cluster-lan --broadcast lan-demo.hang import ts

# On another: discover it and play it.
moq --cluster-lan --broadcast lan-demo.hang export ts | mpv -
```

It composes with the other MoQ sides. The common pairing is a LAN mesh plus a
CDN for everyone else: `--cluster-lan --client-connect
https://relay.example.com/anon` serves viewers on the same network directly
while the relay serves external ones, all from one process and one set of
broadcasts. With `--cluster-lan` alone nothing leaves the local network;
adding a bridge shares the same broadcasts with whatever it connects to, in
both directions.

Joining the mesh requires a token carried in the mDNS advertisement, so merely
reaching the QUIC port (say, on a machine with a public address) grants
nothing. By default anyone on the local network can read the advertisement and
join, so use it on networks you trust. On a network you don't fully trust,
add `--cluster-lan-secret <key-or-path>` to every peer. The value is either a
32-byte key encoded as exactly 64 hexadecimal characters, or a path whose
trimmed contents have that format. A missing file is an error and is never
generated automatically. For example:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > cluster.key
moq --cluster-lan --cluster-lan-secret cluster.key --broadcast lan-demo.hang export ts
```

Joining then requires knowing the key, peers without it are invisible, and the
key itself never travels the network. Peers exchange HMAC proofs bound to each
listener and its advertised identity, so an observed proof cannot be replayed
elsewhere.

`--cluster-node <url>` gives this process the same canonical identity used by
the other cluster mechanisms. When present, the URL is included in mDNS and
used for deduplication and deciding which side dials. Peers still dial the LAN
address and port from mDNS, not the cluster-node URL. Without it, the process
uses a random identity for that run.

### Redundant Publishers (1+1)

Relays key a broadcast's content identity on the publisher's origin id (the
first hop of its announcements). Two publishers of the same broadcast that
share an id are treated as interchangeable sources: relays hold both routes
and fail over between them at a group boundary, so killing one leaves viewers
running off the other.

Sharing an id is a promise: the publishers MUST produce the same broadcast,
meaning the same track names carrying the same content, with group sequences
aligned on the same boundaries. Relays may switch between same-id sources
whenever routing prefers another (not only on failure), splicing at the next
group boundary, so encoders that drift (for example segment-numbered tracks
from processes started at different times) tear down subscribers on the
switch. Independent publishers with different tracks or timelines MUST use
different origin ids; the newcomer then takes the broadcast over instead of
joining. Run the same command from two aligned encoders, pinning the same id
on both:

```bash
moq --origin 42 --client-connect https://relay-a.example.com/anon --broadcast event.hang import ts
moq --origin 42 --client-connect https://relay-b.example.com/anon --broadcast event.hang import ts
```

Leave `--origin` unset everywhere else. The default fresh id per run is what
makes a restarted encoder look like new content (ending subscriptions and
invalidating caches) instead of silently splicing mid-stream. A publisher with
a *different* id takes the broadcast over the moment it announces, ending the
incumbent rather than waiting behind it, so a reconnect is live again without
waiting for the relay's transport to time out the connection it replaced. The
last publisher to announce a path owns it, so use authorization to decide who
may publish where.

### Capture a Webcam

The `capture` subcommand captures and encodes from local devices directly, no
external FFmpeg process required. It publishes the camera as an H.264 video
track and the microphone as an Opus audio track on the same broadcast. It is
gated behind the `capture` feature:

Build (or run) with the feature enabled:

```bash
cargo build --release -p moq-cli --features capture
# or run straight from a checkout:
cargo run -p moq-cli --features capture -- --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast cam.hang import capture

# Default camera + microphone, hardware-encoded H.264 when available:
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast cam.hang import capture

# Pick devices, resolution, and bitrates:
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast cam.hang \
    import capture --camera 0 --width 1280 --height 720 --fps 30 --bitrate 3000000 \
                   --microphone "MacBook Pro Microphone" --audio-bitrate 64000

# One medium only:
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast cam.hang import capture --no-audio
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast cam.hang import capture --no-video

# Pick a codec (default h264). h265 is hardware-only:
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast cam.hang import capture --codec h265

# Capture a display instead of a camera:
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast screen.hang import capture --display --no-audio
```

### Pick a source

The video source is one of `--camera`, `--display`, `--window`, or `--app`;
without one, `capture` opens the default camera. `--camera` and `--display` also
take no value, meaning "the default one".

`moq devices` lists every source the current platform can enumerate and the id
each flag expects, so you can read an id off it and paste it straight in. It
talks only to the local hardware, so it is the one verb that takes no MoQ side:

```bash
moq devices
```

```
Cameras:
  6C707041-05AC-0010-000D-000000000001  FaceTime HD Camera

Displays:
  0  Display 1 (3456x2234)

Windows:
  39193  Safari - MoQ Demo (1200x800)

Applications:
  com.apple.Safari  Safari

Microphones:
  * MacBook Pro Microphone
```

```bash
# A single window, followed as it moves and resizes (macOS only):
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast win.hang \
    import capture --window 39193 --no-audio

# Every window of an application, including ones opened later (macOS only):
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast app.hang \
    import capture --app com.apple.Safari --no-audio

# A specific display, without the mouse cursor:
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast screen.hang \
    import capture --display 1 --no-cursor --no-audio
```

The audio source is `--microphone` or `--system-audio`, defaulting to the default
microphone. `--system-audio` captures everything the machine is playing (minus
this process, so playing the broadcast back doesn't feed itself), which is what
you usually want next to a screen share:

```bash
# Share a screen with its sound (macOS only):
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast screen.hang \
    import capture --display --system-audio
```

On Linux the NVENC (NVIDIA) and VAAPI (Intel/AMD) encoders and the PipeWire
screen capture are compiled in by default and link the CUDA / libva / libpipewire
system libraries. To build `capture` without them (software openh264 + V4L2
camera capture only, no system library dependency), drop the default features:

```bash
cargo build --release -p moq-cli --no-default-features \
    --features "iroh noq websocket capture"
```

Video capture uses a native per-platform backend (AVFoundation on macOS, V4L2 on
Linux, Media Foundation on Windows). `--display` captures a screen instead:
ScreenCaptureKit on macOS, DXGI Desktop Duplication on Windows, and
xdg-desktop-portal + PipeWire on Linux (Wayland and X11), where the desktop's
picker dialog chooses the screen (so the display id is ignored there).
`--window` and `--app` are macOS-only, and `--no-cursor` applies to all three.
On macOS these capture at the logical resolution, i.e. what the screen looks like
to its owner rather than its native pixels: a 2x retina display shares as
1710x1106, not 3420x2214, which keeps the derived bitrate sane. Pass
`--width`/`--height` to capture native pixels instead.
The Linux screen backend links libpipewire and
is behind the default-on `pipewire` feature; drop it (like the codecs above) for
a build without the dependency. The codec is chosen with `--codec`
(`h264` default, or `h265`). For H.264 it picks a hardware encoder
(VideoToolbox on macOS, NVENC on Linux NVIDIA, VAAPI on Linux Intel/AMD) when one
is present, falling back to the built-in software encoder (openh264); force either
with `--hardware` / `--software`. H.265 is hardware-only (VideoToolbox on macOS,
Media Foundation on Windows). `--camera` takes a bare integer as a device index, otherwise a
device path (Linux) or name (a friendly-name substring on Windows, the
AVFoundation `uniqueID` on macOS). Microphone capture uses cpal (CoreAudio /
WASAPI / ALSA) and encodes Opus. `--system-audio` is macOS-only: there is no
loopback input device, so it goes through ScreenCaptureKit (the same API as
screen capture, and the same Screen Recording permission) rather than cpal.

`--bitrate` is a ceiling rather than a fixed rate. When publishing with
`--client-connect`, the video encoder follows the connection's congestion
estimate: it drops below the ceiling as soon as the uplink tightens, and climbs
back gradually once it clears, so a degrading network costs picture quality
instead of stalling the stream. It never encodes above `--bitrate`. Encoders that
can't retune while running (VAAPI today) hold the configured rate and log a
warning. Without `--client-connect` there is no estimate to follow, so the
configured rate is used as-is.

Alternatively, pipe an external FFmpeg process as MPEG-TS:

```bash
# macOS
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i "0:0" -f mpegts - | \
    moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast webcam.hang import ts

# Linux
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 -f mpegts - | \
    moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast webcam.hang import ts
```

### Transcode a Broadcast

The `transcode` verb consumes a broadcast from the relay and publishes a
just-in-time transcoded ladder next to it. The derivative catalog references the
source renditions directly and adds the lower rungs, which are only decoded and
encoded while someone actually watches (or fetches) them. It is gated behind the
`transcode` feature:

```bash
cargo build --release -p moq-cli --features transcode

# Publish `cam.hang/transcode.hang` with the default ladder (1080p..240p,
# filtered to rungs strictly below the source):
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast cam.hang transcode

# Pick the ladder (height:bitrate in bits per second) and pin the codecs:
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast cam.hang     transcode --rung 720:2500000 --rung 360:600000 --encoder nvenc --decoder nvdec

# Publish the derivative somewhere else (the catalog then omits the relative
# source references):
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast cam.hang transcode --output ladder.hang
```

On an NVIDIA GPU the pipeline is fully GPU-resident: one shared NVDEC session
decodes the source for all active rungs, a CUDA kernel resizes each rung's copy,
and NVENC encodes it in place, with no CPU copies. Without a GPU it falls back
to openh264 and CPU scaling. Like `capture`, the hardware backends are on by
default; drop the default features for a software-only build.

### Play a Broadcast

Pull a broadcast back out and play it:

```bash
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang export fmp4 | ffplay -
```

## Encoding Options

### Low Latency Settings

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 \
    -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency \
    -g 30 -keyint_min 30 \
    -c:a aac \
    -f mpegts - | moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang import ts
```

## Container Formats

The container format is the endpoint subcommand: `import <format>` reads it from
stdin, `export <format>` writes it to stdout.

Import formats:

- `avc3` - raw H.264 Annex-B
- `fmp4` - fragmented MP4 / CMAF
- `ts` - MPEG-TS (H.264 / H.265 video; AAC, MP2, AC-3, or E-AC-3 audio)
- `flv` - FLV / RTMP (H.264 video, AAC audio)
- `capture` - capture local devices directly (camera H.264 + microphone Opus; requires the `capture` build feature; does not read stdin)

Export formats:

- `fmp4` - fragmented MP4 / CMAF
- `mkv` - Matroska / WebM
- `ts` - MPEG-TS
- `flv` - FLV / RTMP (H.264 video, AAC audio)
- `h264` - raw H.264 Annex-B
- `h265` - raw H.265 Annex-B

`export` also takes `--catalog-format` to pick which catalog track to read for track
discovery. When omitted, it's auto-detected from the broadcast name suffix
(`.hang` -> `hang`, `.msf` -> `msf`), falling back to `hang`:

- `hang` - the `catalog.json` JSON catalog (default)
- `hangz` - the DEFLATE-compressed `catalog.json.z` catalog (opt-in; shares the `.hang` suffix and is never auto-detected)
- `msf` - the MSF `catalog` track

Stdout exports can also select one rendition per media role before the sink
subcommand:

```bash
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang \
    export --video-name 720p --audio-codec opus fmp4 | ffplay -
```

- `--video-name <name>` picks the video rendition with that exact catalog name.
- `--video-codec <h264|h265|vp8|vp9|av1>` keeps only matching video renditions.
- `--audio-name <name>` picks the audio rendition with that exact catalog name.
- `--audio-codec <aac|opus>` keeps only matching audio renditions.

With no selection flags, every matching rendition is kept. The `h264` and `h265`
export sinks force the matching video codec, so use `export h264` / `export h265`
for raw elementary streams instead of combining those sinks with a contradictory
`--video-codec`.

Every export sink caps how long a stalled group is waited on before the muxer
skips to a newer one. Each owns the knob so its default fits the transport: the
stdout containers and `rtmp` take `--latency-max` (default `500ms`), and `srt`
reuses its `--latency` (the receive buffer doubles as the skip threshold).
WebRTC (`rtc`) is real-time and doesn't buffer, so it has no such knob. HLS
export doesn't subscribe to media at all (segments are fetched on demand), so
it has no latency knob either.

### MPEG-TS

Ingest an MPEG-TS stream from FFmpeg and play one back out:

```bash
# Import: remux a file to MPEG-TS and pipe it in
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c copy -f mpegts - | \
    moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com --broadcast my-stream.hang import ts

# Export: pull MPEG-TS back out and play it
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com --broadcast my-stream.hang export ts | ffplay -
```

TS export carries H.264 / H.265 as Annex-B and AAC as ADTS. Both in-band
(avc3 / hev1) and out-of-band (avc1 / hvc1, e.g. from an fMP4 import) video
sources work: the parameter sets are read from the bitstream or the catalog
`description` and re-injected as Annex-B on each keyframe.

Broadcast audio (MP2, AC-3, E-AC-3) is carried verbatim: complete, well-formed
frames pass through byte-exact, never transcoded; malformed input is rejected
rather than mis-described. Elementary streams the CLI does not decode (SCTE-35
cues, teletext, DVB subtitles, ...) are carried verbatim too, one MoQ track per
PID, described in the catalog `mpegts` section, and survive `import ts` /
`export ts` end-to-end.

The service layer rides the same `mpegts` section. The program identity
(transport stream ID, service number, PMT PID) is captured from the PAT and used to
rebuild a matching PAT/PMT, while the standalone SI tables (SDT, NIT) are carried as
opaque sections and re-emitted byte-for-byte on their original PIDs, each at its own
repetition interval. So the service name, provider, type, and network survive the
round-trip without being parsed. Regenerated tables (TDT/TOT) and EPG (EIT) are not
captured: they are live or bulky rather than static identity.

### FLV

```bash
# Import: remux a file to FLV and pipe it in
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c copy -f flv - | \
    moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com --broadcast my-stream.hang import flv

# Export: pull FLV back out and play it
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com --broadcast my-stream.hang export flv | ffplay -
```

FLV is the classic RTMP container: H.264 video and AAC audio, each with an
out-of-band header. The enhanced E-RTMP FourCC payloads (HEVC, AV1, Opus) and the
older codecs (VP6, MP3) are not supported on the stdin/stdout container path.

## HLS

Import a remote HLS master/media playlist into a MoQ broadcast:

```bash
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang \
    import hls https://example.com/live/master.m3u8
```

Serve one MoQ broadcast as HLS over HTTP (reached at
`http://host:8089/<broadcast>/master.m3u8`):

```bash
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang \
    export hls --listen '[::]:8089'
```

HLS export does not allow cross-origin browser access unless configured. Pass
`--cors-origin <origin>` one or more times to allow specific origins, or
`--cors-origin '*'` to allow any browser origin.

## Network Gateways (RTMP / SRT / WebRTC)

The `rtmp`, `srt`, and `rtc` endpoints bridge other live protocols. Each takes
either `--connect <url>` (dial out) or `--listen <addr>` (bind a socket), and the
parent verb decides the role:

- **import `--listen`** accepts pushes only (an RTMP/SRT publish, a WHIP publish).
- **export `--listen`** serves plays only (an RTMP/SRT play, a WHEP play).

A listener is directional: an import listener rejects plays, and an export
listener rejects publishes. The operator declares the direction; the connecting
peer can't choose.

Every gateway is scoped to the single `--broadcast` (required for a `--listen`):
a listener bridges only that broadcast, ignoring the RTMP app/key and SRT stream
id. (Multi-broadcast routing by app/key belongs behind a relay, via the gateway
libraries' auth-aware API.)

### RTMP ingest to a relay

Accept OBS / FFmpeg RTMP pushes and forward one broadcast to a relay:

```bash
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang \
    import rtmp --listen '[::]:1935'
```

### Restream MoQ to Twitch (RTMP)

Pull a broadcast from a relay and push it to a remote RTMP server:

```bash
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang \
    export rtmp --connect 'rtmp://live.twitch.tv/app/<stream-key>'
```

### SRT

```bash
# Accept incoming SRT publishes as one broadcast and forward to a relay
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang import srt --listen '[::]:9000'

# Serve a broadcast to SRT players
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang export srt --listen '[::]:9000'
```

### WebRTC (WHIP / WHEP)

Direction picks the HTTP role: import `--listen` is a WHIP server, export
`--listen` is a WHEP server. Peers reach the broadcast at
`http://host:8080/<broadcast>`.

```bash
# WHIP ingest: browsers publish one broadcast to us, we forward to a relay
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang import rtc --listen '[::]:8080'

# WHEP playback: serve a broadcast to browsers
moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang export rtc --listen '[::]:8080'
```

The WHIP/WHEP HTTP listener does not allow cross-origin browser access unless
configured. Pass `--cors-origin <origin>` one or more times to allow specific
origins, or `--cors-origin '*'` to allow any browser origin.

## Authentication

Pass a JWT token via the URL's `?jwt=` query parameter:

```bash
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c copy -f mpegts - | \
    moq --client-connect "https://relay.example.com/?jwt=<token>" --broadcast my-stream.hang import ts
```

`moq token` mints those tokens, so a relay operator needs no extra tool:

```bash
# Generate a signing key. Only private.jwk has to stay secret; the relay
# verifies with public.jwk.
moq token generate --algorithm ES256 --out private.jwk --public public.jwk

# Sign a token letting the bearer publish `rooms/123/alice` and watch the room.
# Add `--expires <unix-timestamp>` to bound how long it stays valid.
moq token sign --key private.jwk \
    --root "rooms/123" \
    --publish "alice" \
    --subscribe "" > alice.jwt

# Inspect a token's claims.
moq token verify --key public.jwk --in alice.jwt
```

See [Authentication](/bin/relay/auth) for the key formats, scoping rules, and
relay configuration.

## Test Videos

The repository includes helper commands for test content:

```bash
# Publish Big Buck Bunny
just pub bbb https://relay.example.com/anon

# Publish Tears of Steel
just pub tos https://relay.example.com/anon
```

## Debugging

### Verbose Output

```bash
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c copy -f mpegts - | \
    RUST_LOG=debug moq --client-connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream.hang import ts
```

### Check Connection

```bash
# Verify you can connect to the relay
curl http://relay.example.com:4443/announced/
```

## Common Issues

### "Connection refused"

- Ensure the relay is running
- Check firewall allows UDP traffic
- Verify the URL is correct

### "Invalid certificate"

- The relay needs a valid TLS certificate
- For development, use the fingerprint method
- See [TLS Setup](/bin/relay/#tls-setup)

### "Permission denied"

- Check your JWT token is valid
- Verify the token allows publishing to that path
- See [Authentication](/bin/relay/auth)

## Next Steps

- Deploy a [relay server](/bin/relay/)
- Use [Web Components](/lib/js/env/web) for playback
- Try the [Rust libraries](/lib/rs/) for custom apps
