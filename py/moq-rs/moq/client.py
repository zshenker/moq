    """High-level MoQ client with automatic origin wiring.

    In simple mode (no origin provided), both sides share one origin, so a broadcast
    announced here is also discoverable here:

        async with Client("https://relay.example.com") as client:
            async for ann in client.announced():
                ...

    In advanced mode, provide your own origin for full control:

        origin = OriginProducer()
        client = Client("https://relay.example.com", publish=origin, subscribe=origin)

    For a relay that requires mTLS, pass a paired client certificate and key:

        client = Client("https://relay.example.com", tls_cert="client.pem", tls_key="client.key")

    The session automatically reconnects with backoff when the transport drops, and
    broadcasts consumed through it ride out the gap. Pass ``reconnect=False`` for a
    one-shot dial, or a :class:`Backoff` to tune the retry pacing; watch
    :meth:`Session.status` for the connect/disconnect transitions.
